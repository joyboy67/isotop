.Ss Why this name ?

At first, isotop was a iso file containing all packages and
configuration for intallation.
Now it\(cqs just a script to configure a vanilla OpenBSD.

Like an isotope it is a
variant of OpenBSD with a few more things inside, but still OpenBSD.

.Ss Why is it dark ?
Because the developper like it, and it saves power.

.Ss Can I install another web browser ?

Of course.
Firefox and chromium, amongst others, are available in ports.
However, we choosed iridium because it is unveiled, meaning it can\(cqt access your personal files that might
contains password or ssh keys and it is more privacy friendly than chromium.

.Ss Can I install another desktop environment ?
Of course.

Gnome, kde, lxde, xfce and more are availables for OpenBSD via ports.

.Ss What process are started when I open a session ?

See and edit
.Pa $HOME/.xsession

.Sh How to use my desktop ?

.Ss Start an application

At first, the desktop is almost empty. 

There is xclock at the top left border.

There is cwmwinbar at the top right border, to deal with windows.

Right-click on the background to see the application menu and select, by
example, xterm. 

You can also press Alt-p to show

and type 
.Dq xterm
then press return.

Last, you can move the pointer to the bottom-left corner to pop 
jgmenu.

.Ss Basic window management

You can drag the window by pressing Alt and left-clicking on the window
to move it around. 

To resize the window, press Alt and right-click.

You probably don't need to move and resize windows but to see maximized
instead, or hide it. All of this can be done with keystrokes thanks to
.Xr cwm 1
but you might not remember them all the time. Use the menu at the top
right border (cwmwinbar):

.Bl -bullet
.It
# Send window to group n
.It 
- : Hide a window
.It 
+ : Maximize a window
.It 
x : Close a window
.El

Then, click on the target window.

defaults.

of a
window (quite big by default).

.Ss About window menu

The window menu looks like this : 

.Bd -literal
(4) ![] window name
(4)  [] other window name
(2) &[] another window name
(1) &[foo] again a window name
.Ed

Between parenthesis, the group assigned to the window.

.D1 ! means the window is focused.
.D1 & means the window is hidden.
.D1 [foo] : the window get the label "foo" with Ctrl-alt-n shortcut

.Ss About workspaces

There are no workspaces. They are just a way to increase the size of the
screen, and if you need a bigger screen, the window manager is probably
wrong somewhere.
Instead, cwm uses 
.Em groups
\(.
You can choose to show one ore more grouped windows depending on your
needs.

You can automatically assign a group to a window in 
.Pa $HOME/.cwmrc
or you can use the 
.Cm dgroupwin
to assing a group to a window.

At any time, a middle click on the desktop will show the group menu to
toggle the visibility of active groups.

It is a menu printed at the top of your screen.

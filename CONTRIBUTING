## About dmenu

[dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) is preferred for menus and
scripts.

As much as possible, try to : 

- Load user configuration located in ``$HOME/.dmenurc`` this way : 

	test -s $HOME/.dmenurc && . $HOME/.dmenurc

- Call dmenu following this example : 

	dmenu -l ${l} \
		-fn "${fn}" \
		-nb "${nb}" \
		-nf "${nf}" \
		-sb "${sb}" \
		-sf "${sf}" \
		-p "${PROMPT}")

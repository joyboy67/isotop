.Ss Why dwm?
Moving and resizing windows takes a lot of time. dwm tries to answer
this situation and let the user be really focused on this work instead
of managing windows.

When too much windows are open, we can hide them using "monocle" or
"deck" layout.

Finally, dwm is light and reliable. It is also pledged, see
.Xr pledge 2

.Sh About dmenu
A lot of isotop tools use dmenu. it is patched to enjoy mouse support.

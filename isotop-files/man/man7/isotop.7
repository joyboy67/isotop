\- a simple, fun (?) and pre-configured OpenBSD.
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBisotop\fR
is a script to configure OpenBSD into a great desktop.
As much as possible, tools included in base installation are used.
Therefore, some choice have been made to focus on simplicity and
efficiency.
.sp
.SH "FAQ"
.SS "Where is my desktop?"
In front of your eyes.
The default window manager in isotop is
cwm(5)
Its simplicity help to focus and be
efficient.
.sp
Before installing another window manager or desktop environment, give
cwm a try. We tried to make is nice to use
(see
\fIHow to use my desktop\fR?
).
.SS "How can I configure WiFi?"
Read
hostname.if(5)
and
\fIFAQ-Wireless\fR: \fBhttps://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq6.html#Wireless\fR
A tool will be included in next version of isotop to ease this task.
.SS "How can I add/remove packages?"
A link to
\fIpkg_mgr\fR
is in cwm menu.

.RE
.SS "Why cmus is the default music player?"
It is light, don't need huge dependencies. It is hackable, and even
usable with the mouse if you don't like keyboard. You cas of course
install any other music player you might prefer.
.SS "How to exit cmus without closing it?"
If you start cmus with cwm root menu, it is started in
tmux(1)
, so it can be detached or opened in
multiple terminals.
To detach, press "ctrl-b" then "d".

.SS "Why this name?"
At first, isotop was a iso file containing all packages and
configuration for intallation.
Now it\(cqs just a script to configure a vanilla OpenBSD.
.sp
Like an isotope it is a
variant of OpenBSD with a few more things inside, but still OpenBSD.
.sp
.SS "Why is it dark?"
Because the developper like it, and it saves power.
.sp
.SS "Can I install another web browser?"
Of course.
Firefox and chromium, amongst others, are available in ports.
However, we choosed iridium because it is unveiled, meaning it can\(cqt access your personal files that might
contains password or ssh keys and it is more privacy friendly than chromium.
.sp
.SS "Can I install another desktop environment?"
Of course.
.sp
Gnome, kde, lxde, xfce and more are availables for OpenBSD via ports.

There are no workspaces. They are just a way to increase the size of the

wrong somewhere.

\(.
You can choose to show one ore more grouped windows depending on your
needs.

You can automatically assign a group to a window in
\fI$HOME/.cwmrc\fR
